# FEHRobotW7
A collection of the code created for the Ohio State Engineering class FEH 1282.01H, where a group of four students build and program a fully autonomous robot to complete tasks on a course.

My group, Team W7, includes the following team members: Michael Sidenstick, Noah Timberlake, James Leland, and Drew Katz. The majority of the programming was done by me, Michael Sidenstick, with help from Noah Timberlake. The robot was primarily built by Drew Katz and James Leland with help from Noah Timberlake, and the majority of the documentation was done by Noah Timberlake with help from James Leland. Solidworks development was done by both Drew Katz and James Leland.

This repository holds all of the code used for the Performance Tests (1 through 4), the Explorations (1 through 3), and the final competition.

The robot was programmed using C++, but many of the functions are unique to Ohio State's technology, the Proteus microcontroller. As a result, many of the functions are pulled in from OSU libraries.
