# FEHRobotW7
A collection of the code created for the Ohio State Engineering class FEH 1282.01H, where a group of four students build and program a fully autonomous robot to complete tasks on a course.

My group, Team W7, includes the following team members: Michael Sidenstick, Noah Timberlake, James Leland, and Drew Katz. The majority of the program was done by me, Michael Sidenstick, with help from Noah Timberlake. The robot was primarily built by Drew Katz and James Leland, and the majority of the documentation was done by Noah Timberlake.

This repository holds all of the code used for the Performance Tests (1 through 4), the Explorations (1-3), and the final competition.
