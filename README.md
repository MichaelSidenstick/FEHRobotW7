# FEHRobotW7
A collection of the code created for the Ohio State Engineering class FEH 1282.01H, where a group of four students build and program a fully autonomous robot to complete tasks on a course.

My group, Team W7, includes the following team members: Michael Sidenstick, Noah Timberlake, James Leland, and Drew Katz. The majority of the program was done by me, Michael Sidenstick, with help from Noah Timberlake.
